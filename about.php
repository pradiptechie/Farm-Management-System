        The Indian Farmer-xA0- -xA0- -xA0-The Indian farmer grows crops not just for his own family but for all the families of our country- He works hard in the farms in all weathers- He does not care about his health- His wealth is his crop- He lives a humble life in a small house- At times- he does not even realise the true worth of his grain- He is very often cheated by the moneylenders and paid a pittance for the grains he sells- If the farmers were to give up their occupation- then the people of our country would starve to death- Therefore- we need to realise and acknowledge the importance of the people who-xA0-feed us- Answer from Toppr Admin on toppr.com
