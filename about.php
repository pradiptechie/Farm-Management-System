        <h1>About Us</h1> <br>
        <p>
        
    Mr. Austin Scott of Georgia. Thank you, Cheri and Tom. 
Great to be in your district. All four of my grandparents were 
involved in production agriculture, and none of their grandkids 
are. I think that is one of the challenges that we face as a 
country is who is going to be farming 10 years from now, 
because if you are not farming today you are not going to be 
farming tomorrow, and if you are not farming tomorrow what are 
we going to do for our food over the next couple of decades?
    I got a phone call from a farmer this past week, and I 
think this is an important issue, so if you will bear with me 
for a second. He has been farming for 40 years. He is a hog 
farmer in rural south Georgia. His supplier of soymeal had cut 
his allotment from two semi-loads a week to one semi-load a 
week. In the 40 years he has been farming this is the first 
time he has ever been rationed on his feed for his hogs, and 
like most of the rest of our farmers he buys from ``Big Ag'' on 
the supply side and he sells to ``Big Food'' on the other side, 
and somehow he is supposed to make a living in between on very 
small margins. And the supply chain disruptions that are 
occurring in our food supply chain have created unprecedented 
problems for those who are in production agriculture.
    As we push forward, there are a couple of things that we 
have to be very much aware of. One is our dependence on foreign 
sources for fertilizer, chemicals, and other things I think has 
put us in a dangerous position. If you look at what is 
happening with Ukraine and the Black Sea, Russia is the number 
one producer of nitrogen. Russia and Belarus are number two and 
three in potash.
    We should have never allowed ourselves to get into a 
position where we are dependent on them for our inputs into ag 
production, but we have, and we are going to have to work our 
way out of that, just like we are going to have to work our way 
out of being dependent on chemical production in China. So I am 
very worried about the supply chains and how fast we are able 
to address those issues.
    The other thing I want to mention with production 
agriculture, and then I will turn it over to Tom, if you will 
bear with me for just a second, what is happening in the courts 
with regard to the chemicals that we use is happening very fast 
and it is changing our ability to use environmentally sensitive 
practices like no-till in our ag operations. If you take 
Dicamba off the market, if you take glyphosate off the market, 
guess what? I can't use no-till anymore in production.
    And so one of the things that I think we have got to come 
to some agreement with as we push forward with the next farm 
bill is making sure that the courts take into account the 
impact on production agriculture and our food supply in the 
rulings that they issue in the courts.
    And with that I very much want to hear what you have to 
say, and I am looking forward to working with Cheri and Tom as 
we make sure we take care of production agriculture.

 OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. TOM O'HALLERAN, A REPRESENTATIVE IN 
                     CONGRESS FROM ARIZONA

    Mr. O'Halleran. Thanks for being here, everybody. I really 
appreciate it.
    A little history on me too, I guess. I come from a farming 
family, dairy farmers. They started out in South Dakota, around 
the Fargo area, and ended up down in Harvard, Illinois. And 
even I am not old enough to understand when we lost my 
grandfather's farm after the Great Depression, but that is 
where that Illinois connection comes in.
    Just quickly, you mentioned potash. Northern Arizona is 
full of potash. We have tons and tons, metric tons and 
everything, of it, and here we are worrying about potash from 
some foreign country. That is a problem. We have problems like 
that across our whole mining industry in America. That is a 
huge problem for all of us, and we are trying to make a 
difference in that area.
    I want to thank the Chair for being here today and the 
Ranking Member. Our Committee is one of the most bipartisan 
committees in Congress. We are made up of almost everybody on 
the Committee has some lineage back to farming, and especially 
family farms. That is really, truly something we talk about day 
in and day out, and the importance of not only keeping today's 
family farms but finding the workers and the heritage of the 
family farm through the family to keep it up and going on a 
continual basis.
    It is great to have staff here today to. You look at us and 
you go, well, it is good to be able to talk to a couple of 
Congresspeople here. That staff is there all the time, and they 
are our information source, and the object is obviously, as the 
Chair said, to get an education on how different is this than 
other sections of the country. And there is a difference, we 
know it, but to highlight that is important.
    The farm bill is the largest investment that Congress makes 
into the U.S. food and agriculture industry. We were all here 
for the 2018 Farm Bill, and I am glad to see that we are all 
here for this one. Through the 2018 Farm Bill, Congress 
expanded the broadband deployment that is ongoing, and also 
will be part of the bipartisan infrastructure bill (Pub. L. 
117-58, Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act), and it is 
extremely important.
    There are new challenges now, though, that we are focusing 
on again. Wildfire is one of those that this Committee, and not 
specifically this Subcommittee but the committee in total, 
dwells on, and obviously we all know how important it is not 
only to feed our fellow Americans and the rest of the world but 
also to make sure that we keep on top of that economy as a 
country.
